# Your program should meet the following requirements:

# Write a function or method called find that takes two arguments called path and dir. The path argument should accept a relative or absolute path to a directory where the search should start, while the dir argument should be the name of a directory that you want to find in the given path. Your program should display the absolute paths if it finds a directory with the given name.
# The directory search should be done recursively. This means that the search should also include all subdirectories in the given path.
# Example input: path="./tree", dir="python"


import os

        try:
            os.chdir(path)
        except OSError:
            # Doesn't process a file that isn't a directory.
            return
