#4.3.8   LAB   Character frequency histogram
# Your task is to write a program which:

# asks the user for the input file's name;
# reads the file (if possible) and counts all the Latin letters (lower- and upper-case letters are treated as equal)
# prints a simple histogram in alphabetical order (only non-zero counts should be presented).Tip: We think that a dictionary is a perfect data collection medium for storing the counts

from os import strerror

# Initialize 26 counters for each Latin letter.
# Note: we've used a comprehension to do that.
counters = {chr(ch): 0 for ch in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)}
file_name = input("Enter the name of the file to analyze: ")
try:
    file = open(file_name, "rt")
    for line in file:
        for char in line:
            # If it is a letter...
            if char.isalpha():
                # ... we'll treat it as lower-case and update the appropriate counter.
                counters[char.lower()] += 1
    file.close()
    # Let's output the counters.
    for char in counters.keys():

            print(char, '->', c)
except IOError as e:
    print("I/O error occurred: ", strerror(e.errno))
    


# Sorted character frequency histogram:The previous code needs to be improved.The program should generate followings:
# -> the output histogram will be sorted based on the characters' frequency (the bigger counter should be presented first) 
# -> the histogram should be sent to a file with the same name as the input one, but with the suffix '.hist' (it should be concatenated to the original name)

#4.3.10   LAB   Evaluating students' results:Prof. Jekyll conducts classes with students and regularly makes notes in a text file. Each line of the file contains three elements: the student's first name, the student's last name, and the number of points the student received during certain classes.The elements are separated with white spaces. Each student may appear more than once inside Prof. Jekyll's file.
